%function [EpsHF EpsList EpsGG]=GenCalcHFEps(Y,BTFacs,WInFacs,S)
%
% This will calculate the Geisser-Greenhouse and Huynh-Feldt epsilon value
% for the general case when given a univariate dataset with any amount of 
% between or within subject factors. 
%
% After calling this function, the intention is to multiply the degrees of
% freedom for tests in a repeated measures ANOVA by the corresponding
% epsilon value given by this code to obtain a corrected p-value. The
% F-statistic does not change as a result of this.
%
% Inputs:   
%           Y-  A column vector of the dependent variable (the value
%               measured) for each data point.
%      BTFacs-  A matrix of between subject factors. Must have the same
%               number of rows as Y. Each factor is down a different column
%               of BTFacs, and the value in each row denotes the level of 
%               that factor for each corresponding datapoint in Y. If there
%               are no between subject factors, input an empty matrix, [].
%     WInFacs-  A matrix of within subject factors. Must have the same
%               number of rows as Y. Each factor is down a different column
%               of WInFacs, and the value in each row denotes the level of 
%               that factor for each corresponding datapoint in Y.
%           S-  A column vector of subject numbers corresponding to each
%               datapoint in Y. Must have the same number of rows as Y. If
%               left empty, the program assumes all subjects are entered in
%               the same order for all combinations of factors.
%
% Outputs:
%       EpsHF-  A row vector of all the possible values for the Huynh-Feldt
%               epsilon, correspondding to all main effects for ecah within
%               subject factor, and all interactions of within subject
%               factors.
%     EpsList-  A cell array of a text list of the effects corresponding to
%               the positions in EpsHF. For example 'A' means a main effect
%               for the first (within subject) factor, 'AB' means a 2way 
%               interaction for the first two (within subject) factors, 
%               etc.
%       EpsGG-  The Geisser-Greenhouse epsilon values, in teh same form as
%               EpsHF.
%
% The Huynh-Feldt epsilon value is less conservative while maintaining the
% proper Type I error rate, which is why the program title focuses on that.
% The Geisser-Greenhouse epsilon is calculated first as part of the 
% process of calculating the Huynh-Feldt value, so I've allowed it to be 
% optionally returned as well. 
%
% This code follows a procedure described in Huynh(1978), but includes a 
% modification of the last step, as described in Chen & Dunlap(1994).
%
% I've tested this with results from SPSS for a couple of sample datasets
% I've found in various websites, and it gives results that match
% According to what I've seen and read though, SPSS and SAS give results
% for EpsHF that are wrong when both between and with-in factors are
% present, and thus they slightly differ from the results this program,
% although the results for EpsGG are identical. To reproduce the SPSS 
% results, uncomment line 153. See other comments near there for references
% on why I think SPSS/SAS is wrong.
