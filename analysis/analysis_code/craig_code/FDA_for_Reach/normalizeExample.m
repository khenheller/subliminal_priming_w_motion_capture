%to run this example, you will have to download the FDA scripts from Dr.
%Jim Ramsay's fda site:
%
%ftp://ego.psych.mcgill.ca/pub/ramsay/FDAfuns/Matlab/
%
%make sure you follow the INSTALL.MATLAB.WIN.txt instructions
%
%This script ALSO requires the scripts smoothFDA and evalFDA, which I
%received (and slightly modified) from Dr. Caroline Palmer's lab at McGill:

%function

%the sample trial comes from a recent experiment we conducted (Chapman,
%Gallivan et al, Cognition 116 (2): 168-176) where particpants perform a
%rapid reach toward a single target OR toward two targets. With two
%targets, the final target position is selected only AFTER movement onset.
%NOTE: This trial has already undergone preprocessing and has had any
%missing data filled in (primarily using inpaint_nans, a function available
%on Mathworks forum) has been filtered (lowpass, 10hz) and has had the
%onset and the offset of the reach determined (by velocity criteria) and
%the rest of the data trimmed.

%from the normalizeFDA function:

%data = cell array where each cell holds the x,y,z (as columns) position
%data for each IR (or tracked marker)

%toNormalize = a list of IRs that you want to normalize - this refers to
%the indexes of the data cell array

%normalizeFrames = number of frames you want for your normalized
%trajectories

%normalizeType
%1 = to time
%2 = to x distance
%3 = to y distance
%4 = to z distance

%frameRate = the frame rate of data collection
