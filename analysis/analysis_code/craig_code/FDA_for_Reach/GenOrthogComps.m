%function [M,MList]=GenOrthogComps(nTreats,NormFlag)
%
%This will generate coefficients corresponding to one particular set of
%orthogonal copmarisons for a set of variables, given an input degrees of
%freedom for each variable. 
%
%This is used for multiple comparisons following anova's as well as in the
%huynh-feldt corrections for repeated measures anovas
%
% Inputs:
%   df          - a vector of variable length denoting the degrees of freedom
%              (as in num treatments-1) for each factor. The length of dfs
%              is the number of factors
%   NormFlag    - set to 1 or 0 to determine wether or not you want to
%               normalize the output coefficients. normalization happens so
%               that the sum of the squares of each row of each output
%               matrix sum to 1. Defaults to 1.
%
% Outputs:
%   Mout   -    this is a cell array of a matrix of coefficients
%               corresponding to the matrices M in the Huynh article from
%               1978 that correspond to each main effect and each interaction.
%
%               For example, if nTreats= [3], meaning one factor with 3
%               different levels, the ouput will be: M= [1   -1   0;
%                                                        1/2 1/2 -1]
%               which corresponds to the first comparison of u1-u2 and a
%               second orthogonal copmarison of 1/2*u1 + 1/2*u2 -u3
%
%               Main effects are presented in the first Mout, followed by
%               interactions, starting with 2 way interactions of the first
%               two factors, then 3 way interactions after all the 2-way
%               interactions, etc.
%
%   MList       This is a cell array of a text list of the effects for the
%               corresponding matrices in M. for example 'A' means main
%               effect for the first factor, 'AB' means a 2way interaction
%               for the first two factors, etc.
%
%           To get the matrices needed for the Huynh-Feldt correction, only
%           input the nTreats for all of the within subject factors in your
%           design.
%
% Note this outputs one (relatively easy) way to get orthogonal
% copmarisons, but be aware that tere are infinite different ways to come
% up with a set of orthogonal copmarisons.
%
% For exapmle, running GenOrthogComps([3 3]) give identical outputs to the
% M matrices of table 1 in Huynh H. (1978) "Some approximate tests for repeated
% measurement designs", Psychometrika
