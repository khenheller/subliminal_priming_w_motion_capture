% File organization:
%   Put your experiment output file in a folder with the osciliscope output folders and nothing else.
%   Experiment output file - should be a '.csv' where each column is a variable and each row is a trial.
%                           Put 'sub' in the experiment output file's name.
%                           Timings should be absolute (event timestamp, not event duration).
%   osciloscope folders & files - should be named in rising order (e.g. F0002CH2, F0003CH2, F0004CH2...).
%                               First file (F0002CH2) is matched to first trial.
%               
% Input: test_path - folder with experiment output files and osciloscope output folders. 
%       events - cell array, names of timestamps' headers in output data.
%       desired_durations - double array. Same order as events.
